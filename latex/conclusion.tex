\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a new approach for optimizing the performance of CHP plants. Our approach uses NNs to simulate the complex thermodynamic reactions that occur during the operation of the CHP. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms use the NNs as black box functions for finding optimal operation schedules. Our computational study has revealed that ESPEA is the most suitable algorithm to solve the problem.
