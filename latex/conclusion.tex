\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a neuro-genetic approach for both modeling and optimizing a complete real CHP plant. The modeling is accomplished by means of interconnected Neural Networks where each network deals with one sub-system of the plant. Obtained error rates in the experiments show a satisfactory modeling for both training and test data. Next, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms use the NNs as black box functions for finding optimal operation schedules. Different evolutionary algorithms have been analyzed and obtained results has revealed that ESPEA is the most suitable algorithm to solve the problem. Unlike other similar approaches proposed in the literature, our work addresses the CHP plant problem in a more wide and general way: that is, 1), all the sub-systems of the CHP process are considered, 2) both the modeling and the optimization are carried using Soft Computing approaches, 3) only real values from the physical plant are used in the work, 4) the optimization has been carried out as a multiobjective problem , and 5) the optimization algorithm is fast enough to allow an on-line optimization of the plant.
